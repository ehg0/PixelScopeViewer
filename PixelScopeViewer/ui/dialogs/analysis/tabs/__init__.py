"""Tab widgets for AnalysisDialog.

Contains modular widgets used by the Analysis dialog:
- MetadataTab: table view and copy button for metadata
- HistogramTab: pyqtgraph plot, stats table, and controls
- ProfileTab: pyqtgraph plot, stats table, and controls

These widgets focus on UI construction; behavior and data updates are
coordinated by the parent AnalysisDialog to keep responsibilities clear.
